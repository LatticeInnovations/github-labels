# github-labels
This repository contains all the labels which we would be using in our project development cycle.

### To organise GitHub issues better -
> ### Issues are mainly categorized into two parts

   - **Type** - what type of issue.(e.g bug/question/design change/enhancement).
  
   - **Priority** - how critical the issue is. (e.g high/low )

 #### Won't Fix - this flag specifies that issue is known but we are not resolving the issue. 

There can be custom tags if required for any specific project.
