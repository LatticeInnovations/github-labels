# github-labels
Contains are the labels which we would be using in our project development cycle

Here is the list of labels we will be using to organise GitHub issues better.

### Issues are mainly categorized into two parts

#### 1. Type - what type of issue.(e.g bug/question/design change/enhancement)
#### 2. Priority - how critical the issue is. (e.g high/low )

#### Won't Fix - this flag specifies that issue is known but we are not resolving the issue. 

There can be custom tags if required for any specific project.

The original idea behind this post, here is the LINK.
